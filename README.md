# COVID-19_Analysis

## Basic Data wrangling and Time trends

## This code can be used later in a web app where the user can select a country via a drop down list and the time trend is created for the selected country

## Both Django and Flask are very good candidates for the task

## You are welcome to use this code and create the web app, it will be great if you can drop a description or a link for me to see it.
